## Language definitions
The language definitions are part of the code base, in the file `resources/languages.xml`. 

They are taken from the Language Authority Table, which is a Controlled EU vocabulary that lists
concepts associated with languages. The dataset URI is: `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/language` 
and at the time of writing it can be found 
[here](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/language).
